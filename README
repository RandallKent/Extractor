EmailsFromFile
http://patrickmylund.com/projects/emailsfromfile/

EmailsFromFile is a Python script that extracts all email addresses from a file.
It follows a regular expression pattern based on the RFC 2822 standard and should
thus return all valid email addresses regardless of how they appear in the file.
For example, EmailsFromFile will distinguish between separate email addresses in
a comma-separated list of values, such as a CSV file containing names, addresses,
phone numbers and email addresses.

Usage: python emailsfromfile.py <filename> [separator] [encoding]
